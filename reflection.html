	<p> The term "responsive web design" (RWD) was coined to describe a set of methods that allows web pages to adapt their layout and look to varying screen sizes, resolutions, and other factors. It's a notion that's altered the way we design for a multi-device web, and we'll walk you through the key approaches you'll need to grasp it in this post. Flexible grids and layouts, pictures, and judicious use of CSS media queries are all part of the process. When a user transitions from a laptop to an iPad, the website should adapt to the new device's resolution, picture size, and scripting capabilities. The user's device settings may also need to be considered; for example, if the user has a VPN for iOS on their iPad, the website should not limit the user's access to the page. In other words, the website should be equipped with technology that allows it to adapt to the user's choices automatically. This would eliminate the need for each new item on the market to go through a separate design and development phase.
During this assignment, I learned about various concepts .For instance, building web pages for different platforms, such as the website will automatically adjust according to the plateforme layout, compile with web technologies,will be easy for user to navigate, and most importantly, be user responsive. As a result, if a user switches from one screen to another, there may be a size difference, and to avoid changes in web size surpassing the user screen, it should adjust itself to the size of the device to maintain an easy experience.And in this way we dont have to make different web pages for different devices such as mobile phones,laptops and pc.
I learnt a lot about websites and how much effort it takes to construct a user-friendly website over this entire course (WEB222). I learnt how to utilise HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tags. In HTML, I learned how to create a website's foundation and that all of the main work is done in JavaScript, which contains all of the code that makes a website easy to use. CSS, which is the one file in which a web developer writes the code to make it easy to navigate and use, plays a large role in making a site user pleasant.
